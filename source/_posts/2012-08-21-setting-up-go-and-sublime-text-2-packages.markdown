Instructions to download and install the Go tools are available at <http://golang.org/doc/install>, but in essence you need to do the following:

1.  Download the binaries from <http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list>.
2.  Open the package (possibly with `opt-Open` if the package hasn't been signed) and proceed with installation using the defaults.
3.  To test the installation, open the go folder in the **spikes** repo, and run the **hello.go** sample by issuing

        $ go run hello.go

4.  Install the **GoSublime** package on Sublime Text 2. Instructions are available at <https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime#installation>.
